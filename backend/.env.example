# Backend Environment Variables
# ==============================
# NOTE: For Docker deployments, all configuration is now centralized
# in the root .env file (../../.env). Docker Compose reads from there
# and passes variables to containers at runtime.
#
# This file is only used for local development outside of Docker.
# For production/Docker, do NOT create this file - use the root .env instead.

# Local development defaults
