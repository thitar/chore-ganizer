## 🚀 Initial Setup

### 1. Get the Code
- [ ] Clone or upload the repository
  ```bash
  cd ~/apps
  git clone <your-repo-url> chore-ganizer
  cd chore-ganizer
  ```

### 2. Create Required Directories
- [ ] Create data directories
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/backups data/uploads
  ```
- [ ] Set permissions
  ```bash
  chmod 755 data data/backups data/uploads
  ```
- [ ] Create .gitkeep files
  ```bash
  touch data/backups/.gitkeep data/uploads/.gitkeep
  ```

### 3. Configure Environment
- [ ] Copy .env.example to .env
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- [ ] Generate strong SESSION_SECRET
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- [ ] Edit .env file with your values
  ```bash
  nano .env
  ```
  
  **Required changes:**
  - [ ] Set `SESSION_SECRET` to generated value
  - [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your frontend URL
  - [ ] Set `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL
  
  **Example for local network:**
  ```bash
  SESSION_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
  CORS_ORIGIN=http://192.168.1.100:3001
  VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
  ```

### 4. Customize Family Data
- [ ] Edit backend/prisma/seed.ts
- [ ] Update family member names
- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Update email addresses
  
  **Example:**
  ```typescript
  {
    email: 'dad@home',
    password: await bcrypt.hash('your-secure-password', 10),
    name: 'John',
    role: UserRole.PARENT,
  }
  ```
